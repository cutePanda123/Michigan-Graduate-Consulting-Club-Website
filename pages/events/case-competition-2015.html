                                Yashar is a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Mechanical Engineering. His research studies nanoscale heat transfer, which
                                would be crucial for future ultra-efficient thermo-photovoltaic energy conversion. He got
                                his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from University of Tehran, where he did
                                research at the Vehicle, Fuel, and Environment Research Institute (VFERI). His concern for
                                future of STEM education in US led him to become a FIRST robotics competition (FRC) mentor
                                for Ann Arbor’s Pioneer High School team, Pi Hi Samurai. His interests include exercise and

                                Husky. His interest in business strategy has led him to seek a career in management consulting
